## Last Lesson
- random forests
- random forests parameter tuning to make them better
- we used Jupyter Notebook; can use Anaconda, AWS, Crestle, Paperspace

## Interpreting Model
- understand your data better using machine learning
- not true that random forests are a "black box" 
- random forests allow us to understand our data, deeper and more quickly
- we can also look at larger datasets

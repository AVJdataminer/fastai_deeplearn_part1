## Last Lesson
- random forests
- random forests parameter tuning to make them better
- we used Jupyter Notebook; can use Anaconda, AWS, Crestle, Paperspace

## Interpreting Model
- understand your data better using machine learning
- not true that random forests are a "black box" 
- random forests allow us to understand our data, deeper and more quickly
- we can also look at larger datasets

Q:  When do I know to use random forests?  
A:  It's always worth trying.  

Q:  In what situations should I try other things as well?
A:  For **unstructured data**, such as audio, NLP or images, will want to use deep learning  
A:  Outside of that, will also want to use collaborative filtering modeling  (neither Random Forests or Deep Learning)

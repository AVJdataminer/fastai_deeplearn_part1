### ANN  (Artificial Neural Network)

### CNN / ConvNet (Convolutional Neural Network)
is a type of feed-forward artificial neural network in which the connectivity pattern between its neurons is inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex

### CUDA
CUDA is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by Nvidia. ... When it was first introduced by Nvidia, the name CUDA was an acronym for Compute Unified Device Architecture, but Nvidia subsequently dropped the use of the acronym.

### GloVe
Global vectors

### RNN  (Recurrent Neural Network)
a class of artificial neural network where connections between units form a directed cycle. This creates an internal state of the network which allows it to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. 

### Dropout
* Regularization technique in neural networks to prevent overfitting
* dropping some neurons in a layer

### Reinforcement Learning
???

### ReLU
Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, which is zero when x &lt 0 and then linear with slope 1 when x &gt 0. 

### LSTM  (Long Short-Term Memory-Networks)
* An LSTM unit is a recurrent network unit that excels at remembering values for either long or short durations of time. The key to this ability is that it uses no activation function within its recurrent components. Thus, the stored value is not iteratively squashed over time, and the gradient or blame term does not tend to vanish when Backpropagation through time is applied to train it.

### t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
is a (prize-winning) technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets. The technique can be implemented via Barnes-Hut approximations, allowing it to be applied on large real-world datasets. We applied it on data sets with up to 30 million examples. 


### BLEU (bilingual evaluation understudy) 
is an algorithm for evaluating the quality of text which has been machine-translated from one natural language to another. Quality is considered to be the correspondence between a machine's output and that of a human: "the closer a machine translation is to a professional human translation, the better it is" â€“ this is the central idea behind BLEU.[1][2] BLEU was one of the first metrics to achieve a high correlation with human judgements of quality,[3][4] and remains one of the most popular automated and inexpensive metrics.

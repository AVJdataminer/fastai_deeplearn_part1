## Theme of Part 1
- classification and regression with deep learning
- identifying best practices
- here are 3 lines of code for image classification
- first 4 lessons were NLP, structured data, collaborative filtering
- last 3 lessons were above topics in more detail, more detailed code

## Theme of Part 2
- generative modeling
- creating a sentence, neural translation
- creating an image, style transfer
- moving from best practices to speculative practices

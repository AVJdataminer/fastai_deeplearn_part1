## Deep Learning
* Deep learning is a particular way of doing machine learning
* [Arthur Samuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel)
  * he invented machine learning
  * rather than programming, step-by-step, give the computer *examples*
    * **let the computer figure out the problem by giving it examples**
  * let computer play checkers against itself thousands of times; it figured out which parameters worked the best
  * Samuel **Checkers-playing** Program appears to be the world's first self-learning program, and as such a very early demonstration of the fundamental concept of artificial intelligence (AI); 1962
  * he worked at Bell Labs and IBM, then Stanford Univ
  
### Machine Learning
#### Example:  ML Algorithm in Predicting Breast Cancer Survival Based on Pathology Slides
* start with pictures of breast cancer slides
* work with computer scientists, pathologists worked together to determine features that would predict who would survive or not, based on slides
* process of building model can take some time (many years); can pass data into ML algorithm, such as logistic regression; regression can determine which sets of features separate out the 2 classes
* this can work well, but requires a lot of experts and requires the feature data
* this ML algorithm was more accurate at predicting breast cancer survival than human pathologists 

#### Examples of ML Uses, Thanks to Deep Learning
* gmail, generates automatic responses to emails.
* skype, translate to different languages, in real time
* At Google, every single part of the company uses deep learning

  * took mouse movements on web pages, turned them into pictures, tracking where mouse moved.  
  * fed data into convolutional neural network
  * used for fraud detection

#### Future Work
How do we get computers and humans to work better together?   

#### Societal Implications
* [The wonderful and terrifying implications of computers that can learn](https://www.ted.com/talks/jeremy_howard_the_wonderful_and_terrifying_implications_of_computers_that_can_learn) (Ted Talk by Jeremy Howard 2014)
* ML / DL algorithms need to be in the hands of practioners who understand the economics / implications of the algorithms.  
* practioners who understand societal implications; what kind of problems should be solved; what does a good solution look like...

#### Goal of This Course
* that people from all different backgrounds will use deep learning to solve problems

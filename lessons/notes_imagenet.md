# Winners of ImageNet
9 Deep Learning Papers (winners)

Architectures
AlexNet, 2012 (Stanford)
ZF Net, 2013 (Matthew Zeiler and Rob Fergus from NYU)
VGG Net, 2014 (Oxford Univ group)
Last of the really powerful simple architectures
VGGâ€™s simpler approach is not much less accurate than others
For teaching purposes, it is pretty State of the art AND easy to understand
Excellent for the problems that differ (like satellite imagery vs simple photos)
GoogLeNet, Inception module, 2015
ResNet, 2016 (Microsoft)

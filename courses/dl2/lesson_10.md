## Review of Last Week
- if you are finding the material difficult, that's ok
- there are quite a few in-class fastai students who are doing this full-time and some of them are struggling with this material
- one of the reasons Jeremy had that content early on is we've got something to **cogitate** and think about and gradually work towards so by Lesson 14, you'll get a second crack at it

## Reading Papers (Research Journal Publications)
- not enough students are reading the papers!  The papers are the real ground truth
- a lot of people aren't reading the papers because they think they can't read the papers, but YOU ARE, because you are here

### Debugger
```python
pdb.set_trace()
```

### Match the Equations to the Code
- [List of Mathematical Symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_symbols)

### Re-create things (graphs) you see in the papers
- "Try to recreate this chart, and make sure you understand what it's saying and why it matters"

### `00:16:40` We've moved from *torchtext* to *fastai.text*
- no parallel processing
- hard to do simple things (like multi-label classification)
- no obvious way to save intermediate calculations
- somewhat convoluted API
- looking at transformations to images and asking "how does that apply to NLP?"
